### Assumptions / requirements

- .block selectors (including media queries, pseudoelement)

- If a modifier takes a value sometimes, it always takes a value

- Only one type of selector per media query (where type indicates that they should go in the same file.)


# TODOs

- rewrite each block.css file with imports in the front
- prevent from making folders for pseudo-selectors
- testing
- refactoring
